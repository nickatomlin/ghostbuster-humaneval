# Human Evaluation for Ghostbuster
This code generates a website and asks users to guess whether essays were written by humans or ChatGPT. To run it, simply navigate to the home directory of this repository and run:
```
flask run
```
If `config.json` or the corresponding environment variables are set correctly, logs for each game will be stored to an S3 bucket. A screenshot of the interface is shown below:
